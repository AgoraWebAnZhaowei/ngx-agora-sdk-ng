## Join and Leave Channel

### 1. Join Channel
For joing a channel first of all you have to create an instance of **IChannelClient**, after that you can use **joinVideo** method to join a channel. **joinVideo** method is promise base. The result of promise is an player object. 
```ts
public joinVideoChannel(): void {

    this.client = this.agoraService.createChannelClient();
    this.client.joinVideo(this.channelName, this.token).then(local => {
      local.play(this.localPlayer);
    });

}
```
### 2. Leave Channel

```ts

public leaveVideoChannel(): void {
    this.client.leaveVideo();
}

```
